AWS Global Infrastructure
Data Centers: The  physical locations where data resides and processing occurs. These are built in clusters within global regions. They are the foundation of the AWS infrastructure.

AWS Region: a physical geographical location with multiple Availability Zones, available across North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the globe.
Considerations for choosing an AWS Region include compliance with data governance, reduced latency for enhanced user experience, availability of specific services and features, and varying pricing/cost.

Availability Zones (AZs): comprise one or more discrete data centers designed for fault isolation. They are physically separate to be isolated from disasters and are connected by high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking.
Running systems in multiple AZs within a Region enhances fault tolerance. 

Edge locations: AWS data centers strategically placed closer to users, often in major cities, to deliver services with the lowest possible latency and faster responses.
